Matzes Lisp IRC Library Rewrite 3
(C) 2007 by Mathias Menzel-Nielsen <matze@mausland.de>

Distributed under the beerware-license. See LICENSE for details.


* Prerequisites:

matzlisp, cl-ppcre, split-sequence

You will need to have matzlisp installed. Its ASDF installable so it shouldnt 
be a big deal.

You can get matzlisp via darcs:
	darcs get http://www.matzsoft.de/repo/matzlisp

lisp-irc should run under any common-lisp implementation, however you will need 
an implementation which matzlisp supports (sbcl, LispWorks and clisp for now)



* Install:

lisp-irc is ASDF-installable, so install instructions are easy:
 o Make a symlink to newirc.asd from your ASDF systems directory. 
	e.g: ln -s /path/to/lisp-irc/newirc.asd ~/.sbcl/systems/newirc.asd
 o Load it via asdf
	e.g: (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op 'newirc) in most lisp implementations
	or simply (require 'newirc) in sbcl




look at newdemobot.lisp, for an example bot.

remember to darcs send patches....
