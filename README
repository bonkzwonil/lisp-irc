Matzes Lisp IRC Library Rewrite

Distributed under the beerware-license. See LICENSE for details.

Prerequisites:
You will need matzlisp installed. Its ASDF installable so it shouldnt be a big deal.

lisp-irc should run under any common-lisp implementation, however you will need 
an implementation which matzlisp supports (sbcl and clisp for now)



look at start.lisp, which starts the demobot, for details.
