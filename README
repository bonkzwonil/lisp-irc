Matzes Lisp IRC Library Rewrite 3
(C) 2007 by Mathias Menzel-Nielsen <matze@mausland.de>

Distributed under the beerware-license. See LICENSE for details.

Prerequisites:
You will need matzlisp installed. Its ASDF installable so it shouldnt be a big deal.

lisp-irc should run under any common-lisp implementation, however you will need 
an implementation which matzlisp supports (sbcl, LispWorks and clisp for now)



look at clisp-demo.lisp, which shows starting the demobot in clisp for example.

remember to darcs send patches....
